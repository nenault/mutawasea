          Mutawasea is a simulation of the human disaster that occurs every day
          in the Mediterranean Sea. In makeshift boats, people are crammed
          together, trying to cross the few hundred kilometers that separate
          them from the shores of the European Union. A few rare boats are
          trying to help them. In this simulation, you play the captain of one
          of these boats, you will have to make choices between coming to the
          rescue of all the boats you encounter or focusing on those that are
          most in danger. Click where you want to steer your boat, on the open
          sea or towards the main ports to the north.<br />If they don't deny
          you the opportunity to dock there.
